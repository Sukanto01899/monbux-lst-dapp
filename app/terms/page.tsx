          unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other
          legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or
          reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have
          evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable
          opportunity for further investigation or discovery.
